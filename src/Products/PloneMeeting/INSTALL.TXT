Add a Plone Site and select relevant profiles ("PloneMeeting / test" for example is a test profile installing a default configuration)

The PloneMeeting / test extension profile will add this :

   2 PloneMeeting groups:
   - vendors
   - developers

   and 5 users:
   - pmManager
   - pmCreator1
   - pmReviewer1

   * pmManager has the global role "MeetingManager" and is creator, reviewer and observer
     in the group "developers"
   * pmCreator1 is creator in group "developers"
   * pmReviewer1 is reviewer and observer in group "developers"
