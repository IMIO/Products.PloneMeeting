           permissions exists for managing this problem, but on a too detailed
           level (the field). Managing lots of field-specific permissions is
           laborious, unmaintanable and produces huge workflow descriptions.
           The idea here is to get an intermediate security filter. Very simple:
           people that have View permission on an item where
           item.isPrivacyViewable is False, will be able to consult information
           shown in lists of items (titles, descriptions, decisions), excepted

           belonging to any of the Plone groups related to the MeetingGroup
           which is the proposing group for the item.
           Copy groups and advisers will also be able to access the item.
