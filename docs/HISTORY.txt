  annex confidentialy is ajax switchable in the UI
- When sending an item to antoher meeting config, if both configurations use categories,
  added possibility to define for a category in original meeting configuration what will
  be the used category in the destination meeting configuration
- Added possibility to automatically trigger workflow transitions of an item that is sent
  to another meeting config so the new item can be automatically set in a defined state
  (for example : validated, proposed or presented in a meeting)

  meeting config basis so we know the "workflow path to present an item"

- Added possibility to easily change an advice delay from the advice popup view
  using a drop down box displaying available delays, with comments regarding changed delay and history
- When creating an item from a template, keep every informations defined on the template

  folders (old 'recurringitems' now only contains recurring items and new 'itemtemplates' folder contains
  item templates), added possibility to organize item templates in folders.  Items templates displayed
  to the item creator shows this organization in folders using a 'fancytree', depends on collective.js.fancytree

  adviser using a TAL expression (column 'Available on') and added a way to specify in that
  two or more custom advisers are linked together (column 'Is linked to previous row?')

  ToolPloneMeeting.getGroupsForUser, IAnnexable.getAnnexesToPrint
- Link between a MeetingFile and a MeetingFileType is no more a Reference

- Added 'completeness' functionnality on items (evaulate if complete/incomplete with comments and history)
- Added 'Send to authority?' boolean field on items

  avoid other users also being able to handle it to take it over)
- Refactored management of adviceIndex : index if advice can be added/edited, make use of another
  workflow than meetingadvice_workflow possible, ...
- Pass IAnnexable to a PodTemplate when rendering so we can easily integrate annexes in a generated document
- Removed IAnnexable.getAnnexesInOrder, only use IAnnexable.getAnnexes that is always ordered
- Added ajax switch in the UI for MeetingItem.budgetRelated displaying/hidding
  the MeetingItem.budgetInfos field on the item view
- Display PodTemplate description as plain/text on the PodTemplate view and in the title displayed
  when hovering the template label on the meeting/item view.  Display tthis description on the list
  of Pod Templates of the MeetingConfig as well
- Use collective.datagridcolumns for the MeetingFileType.subTypes field
- Refactored index 'indexAdvisers' to avoid relying on suffixes like '0' or '1', but
  using readable suffixes like '_advice_not_given', '_advice_delay_exceeded' or by displaying
  current advice workflow state as suffix
- Added parameter to hide history comments on an item to members outside the proposing group
- Do not use the 'Type' index in our searches, use the 'portal_type' index because 'Type' is indexing
  the 'Title' of the content type that may change, but 'portal_type' that index the 'id' will never changes
- Removed 'signatureNotAlone' from fields transform types, this is now managed by the 'keepWithNext'
  parameter passed to MeetingItem.getDecision or MeetingItem.getDeliberation
- Removed utils.getOsTempFolder method, use builtin tempfile.gettempdir python method instead
- Cleaned up utils, removed useless methods kupuEquals, allowManagerToCreateIn and disallowManagerToCreateIn
- Removed ToolPloneMeeting.ploneDiskAware functionnality and relative code
- Highlight 'History' link if a comment was added to last event of the history, to do so
  we override the documentby_line.pt template (the python viewlet was alredy overrided)
  and we remove nasty jQuery that was hidding link to author (removeLinkOnByLine)
- Make it possible to access item history directly from the item listings
  (using imio.actionspanel 'history' section)
- Optimized method that update advices nightly so only relevant items are updated, not
  every items like before (that was taking time for applications having several items)
- Added profiling.zcml that allows to activate collective.profiler during development
- Display every relevant informations about MeetingGroups, Categories and PodTemplates
  where it is listed (ToolPloneMeeting view and MeetingConfig view)
- Display annexes and advices fieldset on the item view in any cases, not hidding when empty
  or so, when no annex or no advice, a simple '-' is displayed in the fieldset
- Added topic to 'search items of my groups', returning every items of groups a user is
  in, no matter what role the user has in the group (creator, reviewer, adviser, ...)
- Added topic to 'validable items', returning every items the user may validate upon states
  of the item reviewing process.  Adapted topic that search 'items to validate' to only return
  items to validate of the highest hierarchic level of the current user
- MeetingItem.onDuplicated and MeetingItem.onDuplicatedFromConfig hooks are now zope.event events
- It is now possible to define in MeetingConfig.itemsListVisibleFields which fields of the items
  will be shown/hidden when using the 'glasses' icon action.  Those extra informations about
  the items are displayed in the items listings (my items, all items, ...) and in the different
  listings of the meeting view (available items, presented items and late items)
- An item can now be presented in a meeting from anywhere in the application
  (listings of items, item view, ...), clicking on the 'present' action will present
  the item to the next available meeting.  Before, the 'present' action was only shown in the
  list of available items of the meeting view
- On the item view, display the navigation widget also at the bottom of the view, just
  above the actions buttons
- Renamed ToolPloneMeeting.formatDate to ToolPloneMeeting.formatMeetingDate that now receives
  a meeting as first argument, no more a date or a brain
- Added field MeetingConfig.restrictAccessToSecretItems to be able the enable/disable the
  MeetingItem.isPrivacyViewable check.  Moreover, the isPrivacyViewable check now takes into account
  every explicit access given to the item, so members of the proposing group, super users (Managers,
  MeetingManagers, power observer), copy groups and advisers will have full access to the item
- Corrected bug where an item could be unpresentable if a preferredMeeting was selected on it
  and this preferred meeting was deleted leading this item to not be taken into account by the
  Meeting.getAvailableItems method
- It is now possible to display a topic in portlet_todo or in portlet_plonemeeting without having
  it to be displayed in both portlets.  This is done because now the TAL expression evaluated as
  condition to display the topic receive a 'fromPortletTodo' variable set to True or False and we
  can so discriminate if we want the topic to be displayed in only one of both portlets
- Added workflow adaptation "Pre-validation (reviewer may also prevalidate)" that add a pre-validation
  step but that let users in Plone group _reviewers able to "pre-validate" without being in
  the _prereviewers group.  This let's make difference between real prereviewers and reviewers
  but let reviewers prereview nevertheless
- Added an icon displayed before item title in listings that shows that an item will
  be sent to another meeting configuration so we can see items that will be send and
  items that have already been sent to another meeting configuration
- Added an icon displayed before item title in listings that shows that item was sent back in the
  workflow or that the item is at the same workflow step again (was already in that step before).
  This let's user see that an item was just corrected and sent back or that an item is proposed again
- Locking is now working when using the inline edit functionnality (quick edit of a item or
  meeting field thru the element view) and when quick editing an advice thru the popup
- Simplified tool defineable search parameters : no more max search limit, no more selectable
  item states, one single value for every dashboards about the elements to show per page

  predefined title
